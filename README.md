<h1>eRegister</h1>

The aim of this project is to explore  various aspects of developing a web application, here are the following methods of services use to create this system:

<h2>Check what is needed to run this application</h2>

* You will need s a running local mysql database called eregister and by default connects to the database using a user called webarch and a password of webarch. Obviously this should be changed in a production environment.
* Use the mysql "create database [database_name]" command to create database called "eregister" with default charset utf8 and default collate utf8_bin;.
* The project is a groovy/grails project and needs an installed Java7 JDK and installed grails SDK, preferably grails 2.1.3 

<h2>How to Check Out and run my Project.</h2>

Folow the steps below to run my project into your system:

* Open terminal
* Type in "git clone https://github.com/b1018894/eRegister.git"
* Then type "cd eRegister"
* Finally type "grails runn-app" and navigate to the link that will appear in terminal


<h2>What I have Learned</h2>
I learned quite a lot when building the project, even though at first I was clueless about what to do. I First thing I learned was the use of git hub to manage the project it enables me to be consistent with what I am doing and able to commit any changes that i made and be able to track what i have done. by working with different branches it enables me to know exactly how far off i am with the project which can be seen in my git hub network. secondly, Grails is completely new to me so i learnt how to built an app using grails, and combine it with git hub which enables me to interact with one another.

The one thing  I were familiar with when creating the project where creating the database which was easy but then i have to apply grails technique to add domain classes which i learned and be able to use the domain classes and use gedit to edit the file and apply attributes, constraints, and relationships even though i needed help from my tutor i am able to recognise the to do list and implement it successfully.

The other step which was to create controllers and scaffolds to the project which again is completely new to me, with the help of Ian I am able to implement this easy by just giving me a simple code as it automatically add the files needed when creating controllers through terminal. I then use the controllers to display information in my database using the views which are html files that can be view once the system is up and running (grails run-app).I implemented the controllers and tried to apply RESTful web services which I found difficult as i could not successfully finish it (classes controller section.)

In summary i enjoyed the experience creating the system as it enables me to learn new skill and develop it further.
